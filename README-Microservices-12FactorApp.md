In this exercise, you will push a restful data microservice.

> Note: Currently this microservice does not adhere to all of the 12 factor app principles.

### The App
The app is a very simple Spring Data Rest application. You can download the jar file here: [people.jar](http://cloud-native-workshop.cloudfoundry.org/resources/people.jar).
If you are comfortable with git and gradle, you can also clone the source here <https://github.com/spgreenberg/people> and build it yourself.

#### Push
Use cf push to deploy the application. You should:
- Create 1 instance of the app
- Allocate 750M of memory
- Use the -p flag to point to the jar file
- Use –random-route to ensure no collisions with other students

` cf push people --random-route -b java_buildpack -p ...`

Make sure your app deployed correctly:

` cf apps `
  ...

```name     requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
    people   started           1/1         750M     1G     people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io
```
The app also has an endpoint called /people. You should also be able to curl it:
On Windows, if you don’t have curl you can get it from here: <https://curl.haxx.se/download.html>

` curl people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people` 
   ...

```{
  "_embedded" : {
    "people" : [ ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/profile/people"
    },
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people/search"
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 0,
    "totalPages" : 0,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
``` 

### Adding Data
You can add data by issuing a curl request to POST to the people endpoint. Be sure to replace your information and URL below:

```curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"firstName":"Steve", "lastName":"Greenberg", "company":"Pivotal"}' http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people
```
Now, you should see the data:

`curl http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people`
 ...

```{
  "_embedded" : {
    "people" : [ {
      "firstName" : "Steve",
      "lastName" : "Greenberg",
      "company" : "Pivotal",
      "_links" : {
        "self" : {
          "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people/1"
        },
        "person" : {
          "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people/1"
        }
      }
    } ]
  },
  "_links" : {
    "self" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people"
    },
    "profile" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/profile/people"
    },
    "search" : {
      "href" : "http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people/search"
    }
  },
  "page" : {
    "size" : 20,
    "totalElements" : 1,
    "totalPages" : 1,
    "number" : 0
  }
}
```

#### Restart your App
Now restart your app with cf restart.

Curl your app again:

` curl http://people-<RANDOM_ROUTE>.cfapps.io/people`

What happened? Why? Not very durable, right? We will correct this in the next exercise
